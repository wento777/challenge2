            <h2>About me</h2>
            Hi my name is Andrei Florea I was born on the 20th of July, 1985 in Chisinau, Moldova. I moved to the United
            States in 2008. I speak three languages Romanian, Russian and English, my first language is Romanian.
            I was an average student throughout my academic life. Extra- curricular activities like sports, math,
            history were my favorite things. I play many sports in school like tennis, soccer.
            I want to upgrade some aspects of my life and I decided to go back to school. After 7 years working
            full-time at Hen house in meat/seafood department I decided to get my CDL and become a truck driver.
            I been working 6 years for Crete Carrier as a full-time truck driver. I want to finish my Bootcamp course in
            coding and web design to have a better job and work from home.
